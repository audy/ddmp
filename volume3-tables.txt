h
  Pigmentation: Bacillus subtilis may form pigments, varying from cream through yellow, orange, pink and red, to brown
or black, on potato or agar media containing glucose, and strains forming brown or black pigment were often formerly
called “Bacillus subtilis var. aterrimus”; Bacillus algicola produces semitransparent, creamy, slightly yellowish colonies; Bacil-
lus aquimaris colonies are pale orange-yellow; Bacillus arseniciselenatis and Bacillus selenitireducens will produce red colonies,
owing to elemental selenium precipitation, on selenium oxide media; Bacillus atrophaeus forms a dark brownish-black soluble
pigment in 2–6 d on media containing tyrosine or other organic nitrogen source; Bacillus carboniphilus produces grayish
yellow pigment on nutrient agar and brownish red pigment on trypto-soya agar; some strains of Bacillus cereus may produce
a yellowish-green fluorescent pigment on various media, some strains may produce a pinkish brown diffusible pigment on
nutrient agar, and on starch-containing media containing sufficient iron some strains produce the red pigment pulcher-
rimin; Bacillus clarkii colonies may be cream-white to pale yellow in color, and one of the three strains described produces
dark yellow colonies with age; Bacillus endophyticus colonies may be white or pink-red, even on the same plate, and media
containing ampicillin and lysozyme commonly yield red colonies; colonies of Bacillus fastidiosus on uric acid medium may
become yellowish; Bacillus firmus colonies are creamy-yellow to pale orangey-brown after 3 d on TSA at 30 °C; Bacillus gibsonii
colonies are yellow; Bacillus indicus colonies are yellowish-orange; Bacillus hwaijinpoensis colonies are light yellow; Bacillus jeot-
gali colonies are cream-yellow to light orange-yellow; many strains of Bacillus licheniformis can produce red pigment (assumed
to be pulcherrimin) on carbohydrate media containing sufficient iron, and colonies on glycerol/glutamate medium are
reddish-brown; Bacillus marisflavi colonies are pale yellow; Bacillus megaterium colonies may become yellow and then brown or
black on long incubation; Bacillus pseudofirmus colonies are yellow; Bacillus sonorensis colonies are yellowish-cream on routine
media, and bright yellow on pH 5.6 agar; Bacillus subterraneus colonies are dark yellow to orange on tryptic soy agar.
i
  Citrate test results may vary according to the test method used; Gordon et al. (1973) found citrate utilization to be a variable
property among 23 strains of Bacillus anthracis, while Logan and Berkeley (1984) and Logan et al. (1985) obtained negative
results for 37 strains using the API 20E test method. For Bacillus badius, Gordon et al. (1973) obtained negative results with
two strains, while Logan and Berkeley (1984) obtained positive results for two strains using the API 20E test method.
j
 Strains of Bacillus cereus of serovars 1, 3, 5, and 8, which are particularly associated with outbreaks of emetic-type food poison-
ing, do not produce acid from salicin and starch, whereas strains of Bacillus cereus of other serotypes are usually positive for
these reactions. See Table 7.
k
  For Bacillus fumarioli, acid production from carbohydrates is tested at pH 6 – see Logan et al. (2000) and Testing for special characters.
l
  Gordon et al. (1973) found the Voges–Proskauer reaction to be negative for 60 strains of Bacillus megaterium, while Logan
and Berkeley (1984) obtained positive results for all but one of 33 strains using the API 20E test method.
m
   Acid production from carbohydrates by Bacillus naganoensis is slow, and shows only after extended (>14 d) incubation.
n
  The published description of Bacillus pseudomycoides (Nakamura, 1998) records that 7% salt is tolerated, but the differentia-
tion table in that publication indicates the opposite result.
o
  Spores of Bacillus psychrodurans and Bacillus psychrotolerans are rarely formed; on casein-peptone soymeal-peptone agar
spores are predominantly spherical, but on marine agar they are predominantly ellipsoidal.
p
  Mosquitocidal strains of Bacillus sphaericus produce parasporal toxin crystals which are smaller than those produced by Bacil-
lus thuringiensis, but which are nonetheless visible by phase-contrast microscopy.
q
  Growth occurs within the range pH 7.2–9.5 in media adjusted with NaOH and HCl, but not in media where the pH is
adjusted using buffered systems as described by Nielsen et al. (1995a).
r
  Negative when incubated at 30 °C, but may become positive slowly when incubated at 40 °C.
s
  Growth is poor in the absence of NaCl.

                  Bacillus subtilis may form pigments, varying from cream through yellow, orange, pink and red, to brown
                or black, on potato or agar media containing glucose; strains forming brown or black pigment were often
                formerly called “Bacillus subtilis var. aterrimus.”

 Bacillus algicola produces semitransparent, creamy, slightly yellowish colonies; Bacillus arseniciselenatis and Bacillus selenitireducens will produce
red colonies, owing to elemental selenium precipitation, on selenium oxide media; Bacillus clarkii colonies may be cream-white to pale yellow in
color, and one of the three strains described produces dark yellow colonies with age; Bacillus pseudofirmus colonies are yellow.
d
  Bacillus arseniciselenatis does not grow aerobically; Bacillus selenitireducens grows weakly in microaerobic conditions.

FIGURE 13. Evolutionary relationships within the genus Anoxybacillus. The evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbor-joining method.
The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 2,000 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa. The percentage of replicate
trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (2,000 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to
scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances
were computed using the Jukes–Cantor method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and
missing data were eliminated from the dataset (Complete deletion option). There were a total of 1,298 positions in the final dataset. Phylogenetic
analyses were conducted in mega software version 4.

              of Saitou and Nei (1987). Phylogenetic distances were calculated as described by Jukes and Cantor (1969). The

   Pasteuria penetrans and Pasteuria nishizawae, and the rounded-
   square shape for Pasteuria thornei. The outer spore coat is thick-
   est laterally, thinner on top and thinnest across the bottom
   of the spore, being 7–8 times thicker laterally than along the
   bottom. These measurements contrast with all other described
   species having outer spore coats with relatively uniform thick-
   ness. No basal ring exists around the pore opening as in Pasteu-
   ria penetrans. The outer coat wall thickness at its thickest point
   is >15% (both walls >30%) of the diameter of the central body
   compared with 3 to <13% (both walls 6 to <25%) for the other
   described species of Pasteuria. The epicortical wall remnant
   of the mature endospore occurs between the cortex and the
   inner spore coat in a sublateral band, similar to Pasteuria thornei
   but different from the other three described species. The epi-

   longicaudatus and co-cultivation on excised axenic root or green-

   infection is via cuticular penetration by attached endospores
   that occurs on all stages of Belonolaimus longicaudatus except
   eggs. Sporogenesis, which leads to the death of the host, occurs
   in the pseudocoelom of J3 through adult stage nematodes.
   Sporogenesis is typical of other nematode-specific Pasteuria.

Enrichment and isolation procedures
Caryophanon strains can be isolated only after an enrichment
step. According to Pringsheim and Robinow (1947) and Weeks
and Kelley (1958), samples of fresh cow dung are collected,
placed in closed bottles, and kept at room temperature. After
1 to 2 d, when Caryophanon has multiplied in the sample, a
loopful of dung is suspended in a few drops of tap water. Sam-
ples that are microscopically rich in Caryophanon latum are
streaked on cow dung agar or peptone-yeast extract-acetate
agar. Small sized granular colonies of the large bacterium,
among those of other organisms, are visible after about 24 h.
With the aid of a dissecting microscope colonies can be picked
with a capillary pipette or needle and checked microscopically
for the presence of Caryophanon. Pure cultures are obtained
by repeated re-streaking on agar plates. Provost and Doetsch
(1962) isolated Caryophanon latum by the following method.
                                                                     FIGURE 60. Caryophanon latum strain Lenglern; clarified manure

mount preparations are examined microscopically for typical
trichomes. Part of a positive sample is sterilized at 121°C for
15 min and is then inoculated with several loops of material
taken from the remaining portion. After incubation for 24 h
at room temperature, the inoculated dung sample usually
shows high numbers of trichomes. About 2 g enriched sample
is suspended in 10 ml water. The suspension is forced through
several layers of gauze to remove large particles. The filtrate is
centrifuged at 50 g for 8 min and the sediment is resuspended
in water. This process is repeated 10 times. The resulting sedi-
ment is streaked on plates of peptone-yeast extract-acetate
agar. After about 24 h at room temperature, the plates are
examined for minute, granular colonies using a dissecting
microscope. Material from colonies is checked microscopically
for the presence of Caryophanon. Pure cultures are obtained by
repeated streaking.
    Smith and Trentini (1972) used cow dung-streptomycin
agar for the effective isolation of Caryophanon latum. Their
isolation method is based on differential low-speed centrifu-
gation followed by filtration and plating on cow dung agar           FIGURE 61. Caryophanon tenue strain Uelzen; clarified manure extract

the same information basis, BIOLOG substrate panels were
tested (Table 67).
    In general, physiological reactions are weak, leading to many
weak or doubtful positive reactions (Table 67; see also Keddie
and Jones, 1992) Physiological similarities between Kurthia zop-
fii and Kurthia gibsonii support the phylogenetic adjacent posi-
tion of the two type strains in the phylogenetic tree (Figure
66). Nevertheless these two species can be differentiated from
each other by a few reactions, notably utilization of N-acety-
β-d-glucosamine and γ-hydroxybutyric acid by Kurthia zopfii.
Kurthia sibirica shows a more distinct metabolic pattern as it
utilizes d-fructose, d-mannose and d-psicose, but fails to utilize

  Acid production slow.
k
  Weak reaction.
l
  Some reports negative.
m
   Slow reaction.
n
  Positive or weak reaction on Müller–Hinton agar.
o
  Preformed enzyme activities detected are dependent on the test format (substrate) used and may be affected by culture conditions. Individual enzyme activities reported in the literature may therefore vary.
p
  Substrate-dependent.
q
  Results may vary.
r
  Reactions frequently weak.
s
  Conflicting results reported.
t
  Ala-phe-pro, alanyl-phenylalanyl-proline [arylamidase].
u
  Reported results differ.
v
  β-Hemolysis may be obtained on horse blood-containing agar.
w
   O antigen present in biovar 1 strains.
x
  Abbreviation of peptidoglycan type according to Schleifer and Kandler (1972).

a
  Symbols: +, >85% positive; d, different strains give different reactions (16–84% positive); −, 0–15% positive; w, weak reaction; ND, not determined.
b
  Isolates become catalase-negative on subculturing.man
c
  Some strains give weak reactions.
d
  Character score differs from Facklam (2002) with the latter’s score also following in parentheses. An additional, useful test according to Facklam (2002) is sensitivity to bacitracin for S. pyogenes and S. phocae only
e
  Preformed enzyme activities detected are dependent on the test format (substrate) used and may be affected by culture conditions. Individual enzyme activities reported in the literature may therefore vary.
f
  Reported results differ.

b
  Data obtained from Gest and Favinger (1983), Beer-Romero and Gest (1987), Beer-Romero et al. (1988), Kimble and Madigan (1992), Kimble et al. (1995), Ormerod et al. (1996a), Stevenson et al. (1997), Takaichi et al.
(1997), Bryantseva et al. (1999), Bryantseva et al. (2000a, 2001a), Takaichi et al. (2003), and Asao et al. (2006).
c
  HPLC analysis was not conducted in determining the type of carotenoid. Bryantseva et al. (2000b) indicated the presence of neurosporene based on the in vivo absorption spectrum peak at 412 nm. However, it is likely that
this is 4,4¢-diaponeurosporene, as for other heliobacteria that grow at neutral pH.
d
  The standard three-letter amino acid abbreviations were used where appropriate. Nitrogen fixation was not tested for Heliorestis baculata and Heliorestis daurensis.
e
  The standard three-letter amino acid abbreviations were used where appropriate. H2S may exist in its anionic form (HS−) at high pH, in which the species of Heliorestis are normally cultured.
f
  Phase-bright structures in the coiled cells were observed in the enrichment cultures; whether these structures were indeed endospores is unknown (Bryantseva et al., 1999). Kimble-Long and Madigan (2001) present molecular

                  Shutt.le.worth′ia. N.L. fem. n. Shuttleworthia named to honor Cyril Shuttleworth, the distinguished British
                  microbiologist.

Slightly curved short rods which occur singly, in pairs, short
chains, or diphtheroidal arrangements. Rods 0.4–0.6 μm in
diameter and 1.0–2.5 μm in length. Gram-stain-positive, non-
spore-forming, and nonmotile. Obligately anaerobic. Optimal
growth temperature 30–37 °C. Several different colony mor-
phologies exist.
   Saccharolytic. Principal end products of glucose fermenta-
tion are acetic, butyric, and lactic acids. Growth in broth media
is good and is stimulated by the presence of fermentable carbo-
hydrates. Esculin is hydrolyzed and indole is produced. Nitrate
is not reduced; arginine and urea are not hydrolyzed. Gelatin
is not liquefied and H2S and catalase are not produced. No
growth in 20% bile.
   Occurs in the oral cavity of man and has been isolated from
periodontal pockets and subgingival plaque.
   DNA G+C content (mol%): 50–51 (HPLC).
   Type species: Shuttleworthia satelles Downes, Munson, Rad-
ford, Spratt and Wade 2002, 1474VP.

Further descriptive information
The colony morphology of the type species, Shuttleworthia satelles,
is variable with three distinct phenotypes observable. The major-
ity of colonies are 0.7–0.9 mm in diameter, circular, entire, with a
gray, low convex center surrounded by a flat, translucent margin

by Stackebrandt et al. (1997) and amended by Kuever et al. (1999)and Imachi et al. (2006). It includes all Pelotomaculum species, which form with
Cryptanaerobacter phenolicus the subcluster Ih, and representatives of the other subclusters, except subcluster Ig that does not contain any validly
named species. The tree was constructed by the Fitch–Margoliash method using a DNA distance matrix, itself based on the Kimura two-parameter
model, with phylip 3.66 package programs. One thousand bootstrap trees were generated, and bootstrap confidence levels (shown as percentages
above nodes) were determined. Bacillus subtilis (Z99104, position 171497–173046) was used as the outgroup organism. In order to include organ-
isms for which the available 16S rDNA sequences are shorter (particularly Pelotomaculum schinkii), only 1357 nucleotides (Escherichia coli position
124–1488) were used for Cryptanaerobacter phenolicus (of 1529 available). Bar = 5 nucleotide substitutions per 100 nucleotide.
