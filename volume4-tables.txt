indicates that these two strains belong to a single species. Since      therefore, this strain is considered as Marinilabilia salmonicolor
Marinilabilia salmonicolor was first described as Cytophaga salmon-     biovar Agarovorans.

  The bite wound isolates do not require N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) for growth.
c
  Porphyromonas asaccharolytica produces a-fucosidase.
d
  Porphyromonas catoniae does not produce a black pigment on blood agar

  Some species are weakly saccharolytic.
f
 Porphyromonas catoniae contains approximately equal amounts of C15:0 anteiso and C15:0 iso as the predominant fatty acids.
g
  Prevotella dentalis lacks menaquinones.

Short rods. Nonsporeforming. Nonmotile. Gram-stain-nega-
tive. Anaerobic. Moderately saccharolytic. Growth is inhibited
by 20% bile. Succinic and acetic acids are the major metabolic
end products in peptone-yeast extract-glucose (PYG) broth, but
lower levels of other short-chain acids may be produced. Malate
dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase are present, but
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate
dehydrogenase are absent. Sphingolipids are produced. The
nonhydroxylated long-chain fatty acids are primarily of the
straight-chain saturated and monounsaturated types; methyl
branched fatty acids are either absent or present in small
amounts. Porphyrins are produced by pigmented species, while
menaquinones are the sole respiratory quinones found in all
species so far studied. Diaminopimelic acid is the only diba-
sic amino acid in the peptidoglycan (Miyagawa et  al., 1981).
N
­ either heptose nor 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid has so far

the oral cavity, but more recently species have been reported
from the intestinal tract of man and animals.

 Symbols: +, 90% or more of the strains or species are positive; −, 10% or less of the strains or species are positive; (+), 90% or more of the strains or species give a weak
or delayed positive response; d, 11–89% of the strains or species are positive; V, varies between references; and *, data in these two boxes were erroneously inverted in
Bernardet et al. (2002). Where optimal growth conditions vary between members of the genus, the different conditions are listed, separated by slashes (the number
of species that can grow under the corresponding conditions is shown in parentheses for the type genus). Abbreviations: FL, free-living; P, parasitic; S, saprophytic; fe,
freshwater environment; me, marine environment; te, terrestrial environment; nd, not determined; F, flexirubin-type pigments; F−, pigments that do not belong to the
flexirubin-type but that have not been further characterized; C, carotenoid-type pigments; A, aerobic growth; ME, microaerobic growth or growth in a CO2-enriched
atmosphere; FA, facultatively anaerobic growth; and AN, anaerobic growth.
b
    The number of species is specified in parentheses after the name of the genus.
A DNA G+C content of 41 mol% has been reported for Flavobacterium saliperosum (Wang et al., 2006).

d
    The transfer of Stanierella latercula to the genus Aquimarina has been proposed recently (O. Nedashkovskaya, personal communication).

e
 Extreme values of growth temperature and NaCl concentration ranges must be interpreted with care: bacterial growth may still be possible between them and the next lower or higher temperatures or NaCl concentra-
tions tested.
f
Degradation of starch by Flavobacterium columnare strains is medium-dependent (see comments on this species in the text).
g
    Values in parentheses are those determined by Bernardet et al. (1996) when different from previously published values.

 Fatty acids that could not be separated by GC using the Microbial Identification System (Microbial ID) software were considered summed features. Summed feature 3 contained C15:0 iso 2-OH and/or C16:1 w7c. Summed

The type of yellow pigment in Chryseobacterium defluvii, Chryseobacterium soldanellicola, Chryseobacterium taeanense, and Kaistella koreensis has not been determined (Kämpfer et al., 2003;
b

Kim et al., 2004; Park et al., 2006b). The yellow pigment produced by members of the genus Sejongia is not of the flexirubin type (Yi et al., 2005b).
c
 Strains of Elizabethkingia meningoseptica are either not pigmented or produce a weak yellow pigment (e.g., the type strain; Bruun and Ursing, 1987) that seems to belong to the
flexirubin type (J.-F. Bernardet, unpublished data).

a hallmark of Dyadobacter, but it is also a trait of Flectobacillus.                                   Dyadobacter, five other genera contain flexirubin-like pigments.
The latter genus, however, is pink-pigmented, not yellow, and                                          However, compared to other genera, Dyadobacter is in the only

tions of Flectobacillus major. Counts on MS agar ranged from             binose, d-xylose, l-rhamnose, amygdalin, arbutin, d-lyxose,
zero to several thousand per ml, and more than 60 isolates were          and l-fucose; adipate was assimilated but not l-arabinose,
obtained from separate samplings. The isolates were strikingly           d-mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, d-maltose, and gluconate;

 Delineation values are derived from a distance matrix of all sequences in Figure 118, based on Jukes–Cantor-corrected distances. Maximum delineation values are
the maximum pairwise distances between any two sequences within a given lineage; mean delineation values are the mean distances between any two sequences from
Figure 118 within a given lineage.
b
    na, Not applicable.
Pairwise distances between sequences from all lineages were compared to that from Fibrobacter succinogenes str. S85, used as a reference.

FIGURE 119.  Distance phylogram of species within the three classes of the phylum Fibrobacteres. Environmental clone sequences are only included
in lineages with no cultivated representatives. The tree was constructed from nearly full-length (>1300 bp) 16S rRNA gene sequences using the
neighbor-joining algorithm with Jukes–Cantor corrected distances. Bootstrap values >50 are shown above corresponding branches and are based
on 1000 replicates.
